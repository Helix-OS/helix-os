Helix OS
========

Helix OS is a rewrite of OS-Thing from scratch, with an emphasis on simplicity and correctness.
The end goal is to be a versatile kernel which is easily modifiable by a programmer.

It currently supports:

- Module loading and linking
- PCI and IDE disks
- Kernel multithreading

Next steps:

- VGA framebuffer
- VFS and FAT32 driver (And eventually an ext2 driver)
- Start working on the userland
- TCP/IP stack

After that:

- Port development tools
- Be self-hosting

Still early in development.
